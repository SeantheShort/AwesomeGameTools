## 1. Pico-8 [https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php]
Pico-8 is a game engine that simulates what older game developement was like, specifically by adding limitations to what the engine can do. While this isn't a game engine everyone should use to make games, it's a fun one to practice that offers a new (and very unique) way of looking at game developement.

## 2. GameNGen [https://gamengen.github.io/]
A truly incredible developement in the AI field of Game Development. Programmers have gotten an AI to generate a playthrough of Doom via stable diffusion. Maybe not a "tool" we can all use, but it's definetly something everyone should be paying attention to.

## 3. Ardour [https://ardour.org/]


## 4. JSFXR [https://github.grumdrig.com/jsfxr/]
I recently used JSFXR for a Game Jam (Pirate Jam 15), and while it was somewhat confusing to use, it can make some truly amazing sound effects. Being able to control every aspect of a sound can be intimidating (and probably will be), but it gives you the ability to make anything you might / will need for game sounds (under a certain aesthetic).

## 5. Can Tree [https://www.cgchan.com/cantree]
In my opinion, trees are some of the hardest things to make for game development. The complex structure of branches and leaves leads to misunderstandings in how trees structure themselves. So learning that there is a tool made for literally generating custom trees is amazing. (Also, if someone finds this for 3D software, please let me know!! I despise modelling trees!)

## 6. Krita [https://krita.org/en/]
Krita is an amazing software I've been using for years that can do anything from photo manipulation (akin to Photoshop) to animation. A truly incredible piece of open source (free!!) software that allows people to be amazingly creative.

## 7. Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/]
A great place to find fonts with open source liscences. Honestly you can find any font style here and it's incredibly useful for game developers who need a unique font for their game.

## 8. Python PIL Library [https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
An amazing library for Python that allows you to do tons of image manipulation. If you know python, I highly recommend learning this library. You have no clue how helpful coding image changes can be. (I've personally used it for resizing pixelated image sequences, which would've taken me hours if I had to do it manually)

## 9. Unity Documentation [https://docs.unity.com/]
This one only really works if you use the Unity Game Engine, but this point should go for all engines. Use the documentation!!! It will have all the information you need about different code objects and functions, and pretty much everything. (Also, if you are a unity dev, look at the time section of Unity Docs, it has a whole lot of useful information)
