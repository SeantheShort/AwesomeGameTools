## 1. Pico-8 [https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php]
Pico-8 is a game engine that simulates what older game developement was like, specifically by adding limitations to what the engine can do. While this isn't a game engine everyone should use to make games, it's a fun one to practice that offers a new (and very unique) way of looking at game developement.

## 2. GameNGen [https://gamengen.github.io/]
A truly incredible developement in the AI field of Game Development. Programmers have gotten an AI to generate a playthrough of Doom via stable diffusion. Maybe not a "tool" we can all use, but it's definetly something everyone should be paying attention to.

## 3. Audacity [https://www.audacityteam.org/]
I've been using Audacity for a few years, and while it is confusing (similarly to JSFXR), it can do so much! It can do (from what I've seen) any kind of audio editing, so it's incredibly useful for any kind of audio editing in game developement. Definetly something worth looking in to!!

## 4. JSFXR [https://github.grumdrig.com/jsfxr/]
I recently used JSFXR for a Game Jam (Pirate Jam 15), and while it was somewhat confusing to use, it can make some truly amazing sound effects. Being able to control every aspect of a sound can be intimidating (and probably will be), but it gives you the ability to make anything you might / will need for game sounds (under a certain aesthetic).

## 5. Can Tree [https://www.cgchan.com/cantree]
In my opinion, trees are some of the hardest things to make for game development. The complex structure of branches and leaves leads to misunderstandings in how trees structure themselves. So learning that there is a tool made for literally generating custom trees is amazing. (Also, if someone finds this for 3D software, please let me know!! I despise modelling trees!)

## 6. Krita [https://krita.org/en/]
Krita is an amazing software I've been using for years that can do anything from photo manipulation (akin to Photoshop) to animation. A truly incredible piece of open source (free!!) software that allows people to be amazingly creative.

## 7. Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/]
A great place to find fonts with open source liscences. Honestly you can find any font style here and it's incredibly useful for game developers who need a unique font for their game.

## 8. Python PIL Library [https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
An amazing library for Python that allows you to do tons of image manipulation. If you know python, I highly recommend learning this library. You have no clue how helpful coding image changes can be. (I've personally used it for resizing pixelated image sequences, which would've taken me hours if I had to do it manually)

## 9. Unity Documentation [https://docs.unity.com/]
This one only really works if you use the Unity Game Engine, but this point should go for all engines. Use the documentation!!! It will have all the information you need about different code objects and functions, and pretty much everything. (Also, if you are a unity dev, look at the time section of Unity Docs, it has a whole lot of useful information)

## 10. Desmos [https://www.desmos.com/]
Desmos is a free calculator system that has 2D and 3D Graphing features, and is one of the most useful tools for game developement. Math is a key part of programming, so having a free tool for easily visualizing mathematical concepts is amazing! I highly recommend diving into the graphing features Desmos offers, as it allows you to make tons of incredible visuals.


# Game Dev Career Parthways
These titles were found from the Credits for Nine Sols (an amazing game)
## 1. Level Designer
As the name implies, they work to create the map, stages, and levels of the game. They also work to design the interactions in the levels, and control the difficulty dependent on the levels.

## 2. Combat Design
Defines the combat mechanics of the game (helping to set the scope). A very important part of game developement, since the player's abilities will be the majority of the player's experience. Combat Designers also work with many other game dev paths, as player mechanics are deeply rooted in all parts of the game (animation, level design, AI, etc).

## 3. System Design
Similar to Combat Design, except the developer focuses on objects outside the player. They help define a large amount of the game, anywhere from projectiles to game progression events.

## 4. Narrative Design
A very new field, narrative designers work to turn the plot of a story into a game. They are not game writers, rather the people who work with the writers to convert their ideas into game mechanics.

## 5. Character Designer
Character Designers work to take the description of a character and turn it into a phesible character model that consistent with the rest of the game. In this way, they are similar to the Concept Designer, but more specialized to characters. They also help to create reference sheets for the 2D and 3D Artists.

## 6. Concept Designer
To put it simply, concept designers design the style of the game before it is really created. They often oversee the work of the 2D and 3D artists to make sure the style is consistent.

## 7. Environment Designer
Environment Designers work with the other members of the art field to ensure that the environment is consistent stylistically, without taking to much away from the main visuals. They often work with the level designers to make sure that the level features are consistent with aspects of the world.

# Game Programming Sub-Fields
## 1. Graphics Programmer
Graphics Programmers work to develop how the graphics are drawn to the screen. They work with the artistic fields to ensure that the art they create can be implented into the game in a stylistcally consitent game.

## 2. Physics Programmer
As the title implies, physics programmers are in charge of developing the physics of the game. They also work on the particles and effects systems of the game. They also need to work in a mix of pure physics and artistic freedom.

## 5. Network Programmer
Network Programmers develop the multiplayer systems of the game, deciding what parts of the game should be sent online. This is a very complicated part of game programming that requires a lot of problem solving.

## 6. Engine Programmer
Engine Prgrammers develop the engine which acutally runs the game. They have to be skilled in many, many aspects of game developement, as the engine will run many parts of it. They also work with system designers to plan for what parts of the game are necessary, thus deciding what will be needed in the game engine.

## 7. Lead Game Programmer
