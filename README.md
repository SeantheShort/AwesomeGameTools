## 1. Pico-8 [https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php]
Pico-8 is a game engine that simulates what older game developement was like, specifically by adding limitations to what the engine can do.

## 2. GameNGen [https://gamengen.github.io/]
A truly incredible developement in the AI field of Game Development. Programmers have gotten an AI to generate a playthrough of Doom via stable diffusion. Maybe not a "tool" we can all use, but it's definetly something everyone should be paying attention to.

## 3. Ardour [https://ardour.org/]


## 4. JSFXR [https://github.grumdrig.com/jsfxr/]
I recently used JSFXR for a Game Jam (Pirate Jam 15), and while it was somewhat confusing to use, it can make some truly amazing sound effects. Being able to control every aspect of a sound can be intimidating (and probably will be), but it gives you the ability to make anything you might / will need for game sounds (under a certain aesthetic).

Trees :D

## 6. Krita [https://krita.org/en/]
Krita is an amazing software I've been using for years that can do anything from photo manipulation (akin to Photoshop) to animation. A truly incredible piece of open source (free!!) software that allows people to be amazingly creative.

## 7. Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/]
A great place to find fonts with various liscenses
